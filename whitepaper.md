# 🐸 The Official Peepo Coin ($PEEPO)

## Summary
Peepo Coin ($PEEPO) is the tokenized form of the global Peepo phenomenon: a meme, an emote, and a symbol of cuteness and community that has spread organically across platforms, languages, and demographics.

The Peepo frog, a younger and wider variation of Pepe the Frog, originated on Finnish imageboard Ylilauta and 4chan and gained massive traction through Twitch and Discord emotes since 2017. It remains one of the most widely used and recognizable expressions in gaming, streaming, and online communities worldwide.

$PEEPO is a community-driven cultural participation token on Solana. It is not a coin trying to manufacture culture. The meme came first, the movement came first, and the token is how people choose to participate on-chain.
